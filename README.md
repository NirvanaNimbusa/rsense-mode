## [RSense](https://github.com/rsense/rsense) mode for Emacs

RSense mode is a minor mode for emacs that provides the best autocomplete for Ruby in town.

### Installation

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niftyn8/rsense-mode/master/rsense-mode.el
cp rsense-mode.el ~/my/emacs/loadpath
```

Then add `(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'rsense-mode)` to your init file.

### Usage

Don't yet. Seriously. This is broke as hell.
